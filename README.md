This theme is based on the excellent [Dazzling](https://wordpress.org/themes/dazzling/) theme, and has been updated with Ignite branding, etc. See the [Dazzling documentation page](https://colorlib.com/wp/support/dazzling) for detailed instructions on using this theme.

To install, choose > Appearance > Themes > Add Themes and upload the zip file.

Next, choose > Appearance > Customize and change the Site Title and Tagline. Under > Header Image, upload a thumbnail of your Ignite's logo (preferably as a transparent PNG at 300x66 px - contact me if you need help creating the logo).

Under > Appearance > Widgets, add the required sections to the Sidebar. For IgniteSydney I use Text boxes to include:

 - social media links
 - EventBrite ticket widget
 - sponsor logos
 - Twitter feed

but you can include anything you like here.

Under the > Appearance > Customize > Menus section, set your main menu in the Navigation section (if you don't already have a menu, configure it under > Appearance > Menus).

The Dazzling theme has the option to include a "featured" post at the top of the homepage:

To set this up:

- under > Posts > Categories set up a new category "about"
- create a new post and include the details you'd like to appear on the homepage
- add this post to the "about" category
- set a [featured image](https://en.support.wordpress.com/featured-images/) for this post

![about](http://i.imgur.com/GryLqhj.jpg)

- under > Appearance > Theme Options ensure the option to show the slider is checked on
- specify the category "about" for the Slider Category
- choose the number of slide items (for IgniteSydney I use a single post only)
