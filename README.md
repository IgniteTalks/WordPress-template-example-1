This theme is based on the excellent [Dazzling](https://wordpress.org/themes/dazzling/) theme, and has been updated with Ignite branding, etc.

To install, choose > Appearance > Themes > Add Themes and upload the zip file.

Next, choose > Appearance > Customize and change the Site Title and Tagline. Under > Header Image, upload a thumbnail of your Ignite's logo (preferably as a transparent PNG at 300x66 px)

Under > Appearance > Widgets, add the required sections to the Sidebar. For IgniteSydney I use Text boxes to include:

 - social media links
 - EventBrite ticket widget
 - sponsor logos
 - Twitter feed

but you can include anything you like here.

Under the > Appearance > Customize > Menus section, set your main menu in the Navigation section (if you don't already have a menu, configure it under > Appearance > Menus).

The Dazzling theme has the option to include a "featured" post at the top of the homepage.
